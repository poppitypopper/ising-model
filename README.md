# Simulating lightly interacting particles using the Ising Model

_An implementation of the Ising Model in Python. This project has been made following several tutorials in Statistical Mechanics and Computational Methods._

## Project overview
The Ising Model is used to model the behaviour of interacting particles. In this specific project it has been used to model the energy of a system consisting of spin-up and sping-down particles. Consider a system with initial properties :
